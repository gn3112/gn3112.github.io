	<p>I obtained my bachelor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham in 2018,
		where my final year thesis focused on robotic manipulation of biological cells. I then started
		and recently graduated in Human and Biological Robotics (MSc) at Imperial College London where I
		researched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_learning">robotic learning</a> for simulataneous manipulation
		and locomotion, as well as <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/05/05/domain-randomization.html">Sim-to-Real</a>.

		<!-- My three years of studying mechanical engineering
		I am familiar
		I enjoy playing tennis regularly and competing at an amateur level. Concerning personal project,
		I own a 3d printer with which I completed a few projects (more in my project section). I enjoy self-learning
		and exploring the application of machine learning.  -->
